The purpose of logical replication (row-based) in databases is to maintain multiple copies of data across different locations or nodes, ensuring that the data remains consistent and up-to-date. Logical replication differs from statement-based replication in how it handles data changes.

**Statement-Based Replication**: In this approach, statements are sent directly to the replicas, which can lead to errors due to non-deterministic functions like `now()` or trigger side-effects. Statement-based replication is simple but error-prone and may not handle concurrent transactions effectively.

**Logical Replication (Row-Based)**: Logical replication, on the other hand, involves sending only the rows that have changed since the last synchronization between the primary site and the replica site. This approach reduces the amount of data being sent to the replicas and can improve performance. However, it requires more complex logic to handle concurrent transactions and ensure consistency.

Key differences between logical and statement-based replication:

1. **Handling of data changes**: Logical replication sends only the rows that have changed, while statement-based replication sends entire statements.
2. **Error handling**: Statement-based replication is prone to errors due to non-deterministic functions, whereas logical replication can handle errors more effectively.
3. **Performance**: Logical replication can improve performance by reducing the amount of data being sent to replicas.

1. What is the purpose of logical replication (row-based) in databases?

Answer: The passage does not specifically mention logical replication (row-based). However, it discusses statement-based replication and write-ahead log (WAL), which are different concepts.

2. How is it different from statement-based replication?

Answer: Not directly addressed in the retrieved passages. However, it can be inferred that logical replication (row-based) is likely to be related to row-level data replication, whereas statement-based replication involves sending entire statements to replicas, including INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.

3. What is the main difference between replication vs partitioning?

Answer: Replication refers to the process of maintaining multiple copies of data in different locations, whereas partitioning involves dividing a table or dataset into smaller chunks based on a specific criteria, such as range or hash value.

4. In which databases does leader-based replication typically occur?

Answer: Leader-Based Replication is commonly used in relational databases like MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.

5. Can the write operation mentioned in passage 10 be sent to one of the followers?

According to the retrieved passages:

1. Redis is considered an in-memory database system, but it also supports durability of data by saving snapshots to disk at specific intervals or using an append-only file (also known as a journal of changes) that can be used for roll-forward if there is a failure.
2. There is no explicit information on how many databases can be stored in Redis simultaneously.

However, based on the general knowledge about Redis and its data storage capabilities, we can infer some limitations:

* Redis stores data in memory by default, but it also uses disk-based snapshots to ensure durability. This means that while multiple databases or datasets might be stored in Redis, they would likely be stored separately as individual keys within a single instance of the database.
* The performance of Redis can degrade significantly if too many connections are made simultaneously, which could limit the effective number of ""databases"" that can be handled by a single instance.

In practice, it is recommended to use separate instances of Redis for each database or dataset to ensure optimal performance and scalability. This approach also allows for easier maintenance, upgrades, and replication of data across multiple instances.

While there is no strict limit on the number of databases that can be stored in Redis simultaneously, using separate instances of Redis for each database is generally considered a best practice to ensure efficient and reliable data storage and retrieval.",7.6953125,3

**Purpose of Logical Replication (Row-Based)**: 

The purpose of logical replication in databases is to replicate data from one location to another, ensuring that the replicated data remains up-to-date and consistent with the original data. This process involves replicating only the changes made to the data, rather than sending the entire dataset.

**Difference from Statement-Based Replication**: 

Logical replication (row-based) differs from statement-based replication in that it replicates only the rows that have been updated or changed, whereas statement-based replication sends all INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements to the replica. Logical replication is more efficient and less prone to errors compared to statement-based replication because it does not require sending the entire dataset with each update.

**Key Differences:**

1.  **Data Replication**: In logical replication (row-based), only the rows that have changed are sent to the follower, whereas in statement-based replication, all INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements are sent.

Logical replication (row-based) is used in databases to replicate data from a primary site to one or more secondary sites. The primary purpose of logical replication is to:

1. Distribute data: Logical replication allows data to be distributed across multiple locations, enabling applications to serve users in different parts of the world with fast performance.
2. Improve availability: By replicating data, databases can continue to operate even if one or more machines go down, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.
3. Enhance scalability: Logical replication enables horizontal scaling by distributing the load across multiple nodes, making it easier to handle growing data volumes.

Logical replication differs from statement-based replication in the way data is replicated:

1. Statement-based replication: In this approach, only specific SQL statements (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) are sent to the replica, without considering the entire transaction.
2. Logical replication (row-based): This approach replicates the actual data changes, including inserted rows, modified rows (before and after), and deleted rows. A transaction log identifies all the rows that changed in each transaction and how they changed.

The key differences between logical and statement-based replication are:

1. Data granularity: Statement-based replication only considers individual SQL statements, whereas logical replication replicates entire data changes.
2. Error handling: Logical replication can handle more complex transactions with multiple operations, while statement-based replication is more prone to errors due to non-deterministic functions like now() or trigger side-effects.
3. Flexibility: Logical replication offers greater flexibility in terms of application-specific replication but requires more planning and configuration.

Overall, logical replication (row-based) provides a more robust and flexible approach to data replication, enabling databases to scale better and provide faster performance for users across multiple locations.",6.16015625,4

1. Snapshots: Redis saves snapshots of its data at specific intervals.
2. Append-only file (journal): This is a log of changes that can be used for roll-forward in case of a failure.

**Logical Replication (Row-Based) in Databases**

The purpose of logical replication is to maintain multiple copies of data in different locations, allowing for scalability and high availability. In row-based replication, only the changes made to rows are replicated, not the entire transaction.

Key differences between logical replication and statement-based replication include:

* **Data replication**: Logical replication replicates only the changed rows, while statement-based replication sends the entire statement (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) to the replica.
* **Error handling**: Statement-based replication can be error-prone due to non-deterministic functions and concurrent transactions. Logical replication is less prone to errors since it only replicates changes made to individual rows.
* **Transaction log**: In logical replication, a transaction log identifies which rows changed in each transaction, making it easier to parse.

**Comparison with Statement-Based Replication**

Statement-based replication sends the entire statement (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) to the replica, whereas logical replication only replicates changes made to individual rows. This makes logical replication more efficient and less prone to errors, but requires additional infrastructure to manage the transaction log.

**Relevant strategies for replication**

Distributed databases often adopt one of three replication strategies:

1. **Single leader model**: All writes go to a single leader node, which then sends replication information to followers.
2. **Multiple leader model**: Multiple nodes serve as leaders, and clients can read from any of them.
3. **Leaderless model**: Each node acts independently, with no central leader.

**Replication methods**

There are three common methods for transmitting replication info:

1. **Statement-based**: Sends entire statements (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) to the replica.
2. **Write-ahead Log (WAL)**: A byte-level log of every change to the database.
3. **Logical (row-based) Log**: For relational databases, replicates inserted rows, modified rows before and after, and deleted rows.

In conclusion, logical replication is a strategy used in distributed databases to maintain multiple copies of data while ensuring consistency and scalability. It differs from statement-based replication in how it handles data replication and error handling.",1.43359375,4

This is particularly useful in distributed environments where data volume or read/write load grows beyond the capacity of a single machine, or when fault tolerance and high availability are required.

This is different from statement-based replication, where changes are represented as SQL statements that are executed on the followers to produce the same effect.

   The main difference between logical and statement-based replication lies in the way changes are transmitted to the followers. In logical replication, a transaction log is used to identify all the rows that changed in each transaction and how they changed. This approach is decoupled from the storage engine, making it easier to parse and more flexible for application-specific replication. In contrast, statement-based replication sends INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements to the followers, which can be error-prone due to non-deterministic functions, trigger side-effects, and difficulty in handling concurrent transactions.

   Replication information is transmitted to followers using methods such as write-ahead log (WAL), logical (row-based) log, and trigger-based replication. The choice of method depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the application. For example, WAL provides a byte-level specification log of every change to the database but requires all leaders and followers to use the same storage engine, making upgrades difficult. On the other hand, trigger-based replication is flexible because changes are logged to a separate table whenever a trigger fires, but it can be more error-prone due to its reliance on application triggers.

   Replication can be synchronous or asynchronous. In synchronous replication, the leader waits for a response from the follower before confirming the transaction, ensuring data consistency at the cost of increased latency. In asynchronous replication, the leader does not wait for confirmation, providing lower latency but potentially sacrificing data consistency in case of network failures or server downtime.

However, since Redis is a key-value data store that supports various data structures (such as lists, sets, and hashes), it can be considered a database in its own right. It's important to note that Redis is not a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL, which support multiple databases per instance.

The documents also mention CockroachDB, a new player on the distributed database scene, and it supports sharding, which allows for horizontal scaling by distributing data across multiple nodes. This means that with CockroachDB, you could potentially have more than one ""database"" (shard) depending on your requirements.

For further clarification about Redis and its capabilities, here's a brief overview:
- Redis is an in-memory key-value store that supports various data structures such as lists, sets, hashes, etc.
- It can be used as a database, cache, or message broker.
- Since it stores data in memory, it provides fast read and write performance.
- It doesn't support the concept of multiple databases like relational databases do.",-4.38671875,3

However, information about databases in general and distributed databases can be gleaned.

   Databases can be either relational or non-relational, and some of the examples given are MySQL, PostgreSQL, CockroachDB (which is a new player on the scene), and many NoSQL systems. Distributed databases store data across more than one node for redundancy and availability. They can be replicated, meaning each block of data is available on multiple nodes to ensure data consistency in case of system failures.

   In terms of the CAP Theorem, it states that a distributed data store cannot provide all three guarantees (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance) simultaneously. This implies that a distributed database can have either Consistency and Partition Tolerance or Availability and Partition Tolerance but not all three at the same time.

   Although Redis is not explicitly mentioned as a distributed database in these documents, it is known to be a popular in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker. Redis supports master-slave replication and provides partitioning through clustering. Therefore, Redis can function as a distributed database under certain configurations.

This is achieved by replicating the changes made to the rows within a database, rather than just the SQL statements that modify them (statement-based replication).

   Logical replication differs from statement-based replication in how it transmits updates to the followers:

   - Statement-based replication sends INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE commands directly to the replica, making it simple but error-prone due to factors like non-deterministic functions and concurrent transactions.
   - Logical replication records each transaction in a detailed log that identifies all the rows affected by the transaction and how they were changed. This makes logical replication more reliable than statement-based replication, as it provides a clear record of the changes made to the data. Additionally, since the storage engine is decoupled from the logical logs, updates can be parsed more easily and upgrades are simpler to implement.

   Both synchronous and asynchronous replication methods can be used with logical replication. In synchronous replication, the leader waits for a response from the follower before completing the transaction, ensuring data consistency at the cost of increased latency. On the other hand, asynchronous replication allows the leader to proceed without waiting for confirmation from the followers, improving performance but increasing the risk of data inconsistencies in the event of a failure.

2. It differs from statement-based replication, which sends specific SQL statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) to a replica, whereas row-based replication replicates entire rows or tables.

In terms of replication strategies, logical replication is often used in combination with leader-based replication models, such as single leader model, multiple leader model, or leaderless model. These models determine how writes are handled and replicated across followers.

Here are some key differences between row-based and statement-based replication:

1. **Data Synchronization**: Row-based replication only copies changed rows from one replica to another, while statement-based replication sends the entire original SQL statement that was executed on a replica.

2. **Efficiency**: Row-based replication can be more efficient because it involves copying specific rows rather than re-executing SQL statements. However, it may require additional overhead for managing and tracking changes in the database.

3. **Concurrency**: Statement-based replication can lead to concurrency issues if multiple clients are updating the same data simultaneously. In contrast, row-based replication can handle concurrent updates more efficiently because only changed rows are replicated.

4. **Error Handling**: Row-based replication is generally less prone to errors caused by non-deterministic functions or triggers on the original server.

5. **Scalability**: Both methods can be scaled horizontally (by adding more replicas) but row-based replication may have a slight performance advantage due to reduced overhead from re-executing SQL statements.

Logical replication involves replicating entire rows or tables in a database, which means that the replica will contain an exact copy of the data from the master node. This approach is different from statement-based replication, where only specific SQL statements (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) are replicated to the follower nodes.

The key differences between logical and statement-based replication are:

1. **Data duplication**: Logical replication creates a complete duplicate of the data in the master node, while statement-based replication only replicates specific SQL statements.
2. **Data consistency**: With logical replication, the replica will always have the same data as the master node, whereas with statement-based replication, the follower nodes may not see all the changes made to the master node.

In terms of purpose, logical replication is useful for:

1. **Offloading data processing**: By replicating entire rows or tables, logical replication can offload some of the data processing load from the master node.
2. **Improving read performance**: Logical replication can provide faster read performance by allowing clients to read from the replica nodes.

However, logical replication also has its limitations, such as:

1. **Increased storage requirements**: The replica will require additional storage space to hold a complete copy of the data.
2. **Data synchronization challenges**: Ensuring that the replica remains up-to-date with the master node can be challenging, especially in cases where there are many concurrent updates.

Logical replication (also known as row-based replication) is a method of replicating data in a distributed database where only the rows that have changed are replicated. This approach differs from statement-based replication in several key ways:

1. **Scope of Replication**: Statement-based replication involves sending entire statements (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) to replicas, whereas logical replication focuses on replicating individual rows that have changed.
2. **Data Transfer**: In statement-based replication, data is transferred as a complete statement, which can lead to issues with non-deterministic functions, trigger side-effects, and concurrent transactions. Logical replication, on the other hand, transfers only the changed rows, reducing the overhead of data transfer and improving scalability.
3. **Transaction Handling**: Statement-based replication can be error-prone due to its simplistic approach. In contrast, logical replication provides a more flexible and parsing-friendly method for handling transactions, as it identifies the specific rows that have changed and their changes.

The main advantages of logical replication (row-based) are:

* Improved scalability: By only replicating changed rows, logical replication reduces the amount of data transferred, making it suitable for high-throughput applications.
* Enhanced fault tolerance: With logical replication, even if one or more nodes go down, the application can continue to operate on the remaining replicas, ensuring high availability.
* Simplified transaction handling: Logical replication's row-based approach makes it easier to manage transactions and handle concurrent updates.

The main difference lies in how changes are transmitted: row-based replication transmits individual row updates, while statement-based replication transmits the SQL statements that caused those updates.

Statement-based replication can be error-prone due to non-deterministic functions like now(), trigger side-effects, and difficulty in handling concurrent transactions. On the other hand, write-ahead log (WAL) is a method used in row-based replication where every change to the database is logged at a byte level. This ensures consistency across the leader and followers because they must implement the same storage engine.

In summary, row-based logical replication and statement-based replication are two common strategies for data replication, with row-based being more robust in handling inconsistencies due to non-deterministic functions and concurrent transactions.",-13.25,4

**Purpose of Logical Replication:**
The purpose of logical replication (row-based) in databases is to maintain a copy of data at one or more sites by synchronizing changes made to the data over time. This allows for improved availability, scalability, and data redundancy.

**Key Features:**

* Logically replicates rows that have been inserted, modified, deleted, or updated.
* A transaction log identifies all changed rows in each transaction.
* Logical logs are decoupled from the storage engine, making them easier to parse.
* Trigger-based changes are logged to a separate table when triggers fire in response to insert, update, or delete operations.

**Comparison with Statement-Based Replication:**
Statement-based replication is another type of replication that involves replicating entire transactions or statements. The main differences between logical and statement-based replication are:

* Logical replication focuses on row-level changes, while statement-based replication replicates complete transactions.
* Logical replication is more flexible but also more error-prone due to the complexity of parsing and applying changes.

**Synchronous vs Asynchronous Replication:**
Replication can be either synchronous or asynchronous. In synchronous replication, the leader node waits for a response from the follower node before considering the transaction complete. In asynchronous replication, the leader node does not wait for confirmation and may proceed with the next transaction without waiting for the follower node to acknowledge the write.

**Challenges:**
When the leader fails, several challenges arise:

* Choosing a new leader node.
* Implementing a consensus strategy to ensure data consistency.
* Using a controller node to appoint a new leader.
* Configuring clients to start writing to the new leader.
* Handling lost writes in asynchronous replication scenarios.
* Avoiding data inconsistencies after the old leader recovers.

Overall, logical replication provides a flexible and scalable way to maintain multiple copies of data in databases. However, it also introduces complexity and requires careful planning and implementation to ensure data consistency and availability.",287.9492188,4

Logical replication (also known as row-based replication) is a method used in databases to replicate data across multiple copies of a database. The primary purpose of logical replication is to enable data synchronization between these copies, ensuring that changes made on one copy are reflected on other copies in real-time.

In the context of relational databases, logical replication involves logging and tracking changes made to rows, such as inserts, updates, and deletes. This information is typically stored in a transaction log or logical log, which contains metadata about the changes made. The purpose of this log is to enable the database system to detect differences between the original data and the replicated data.

Logical replication differs from statement-based replication in several ways:

1. **Change tracking**: Logical replication tracks changes made to rows individually, while statement-based replication monitors entire transactions or statements.
2. **Data consistency**: Logical replication ensures row-level consistency, whereas statement-based replication focuses on transactional consistency.
3. **Error handling**: Because logical replication logs individual row changes, it is more prone to errors than statement-based replication, which can detect and correct issues at the transaction level.

To illustrate the differences between logical and statement-based replication, consider the following:

* Logical replication: If a user inserts a new row into Table A on one copy of the database, the replicated copies will receive the inserted row.
* Statement-based replication: If a user executes a UPDATE statement on Table A, the replicated copies will receive the updated rows for that entire transaction.

In terms of challenges, logical replication can make upgrades more difficult due to potential issues with tracking changes and maintaining data consistency. For example:

* When upgrading one copy of the database, it may be challenging to determine which changes are valid and which ones should be discarded.
* Ensuring that all replicated copies reflect the same changes in real-time can be complicated.

To address these challenges, databases often employ strategies such as:

* Consensus-based approaches, where new leaders are determined based on the number of updates made by each node.
* Controller nodes to appoint new leaders and configure clients to start writing to the new leader.
* Synchronous vs asynchronous replication to balance data consistency with performance.

Ultimately, logical replication provides a flexible way to replicate data across multiple copies of a database, but it also introduces additional complexity and potential errors that must be addressed through careful planning and management.",2.7734375,4

**Purpose of Logical Replication (Row-Based) in Databases**

Logical replication (row-based) in databases serves several purposes, including:

1. **Scalability**: By replicating data across multiple machines, logical replication enables databases to scale horizontally, allowing for increased throughput and handling of growing data volumes.
2. **Fault Tolerance and High Availability**: Logical replication ensures that if one machine goes down, the other replicas can continue to operate, providing high availability and fault tolerance.
3. **Latency**: By replicating data in real-time, logical replication reduces latency, ensuring users receive fast performance, even when accessing data from different parts of the world.

**How it differs from Statement-Based Replication**

Statement-based replication (also known as statement-level or statement-based) is a method where only specific SQL statements are replicated to the followers. This approach has limitations compared to logical replication:

1. **Inability to replicate complex transactions**: Statement-based replication can struggle with replicating complex transactions, such as those involving non-deterministic functions, trigger side-effects, and concurrent transactions.
2. **Limited flexibility**: Logical replication allows for more flexibility in terms of application-specific replication, whereas statement-based replication is limited to specific SQL statements.

**Key differences between logical and statement-based replication**

1. **Data type**: Logical replication logs entire rows or tables, while statement-based replication logs individual SQL statements.
2. **Transaction management**: Logical replication handles transactions more robustly than statement-based replication, as it can replicate entire rows or tables affected by a transaction, rather than just specific statements.
3. **Error handling**: Logical replication is more error-prone due to the complexity of replicating complex transactions, whereas statement-based replication has fewer opportunities for errors.

**Common replication strategies**

Distributed databases often adopt one of three common replication strategies:

1. **Single leader model**: All writes go to a single leader node, which then sends replication information to followers.
2. **Multiple leader model**: Multiple leader nodes handle writes and replication, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.
3. **Leaderless model**: No centralized leader exists; instead, each node makes its own decisions about what data to replicate.

In summary, logical replication (row-based) provides a more scalable, flexible, and robust approach to replicating data in distributed databases compared to statement-based replication.",425.0078125,4

Logical replication (row-based) is a type of replication that replicates entire rows instead of individual changes. The purpose of logical replication is to maintain multiple copies of data in different locations, often for disaster recovery or business continuity purposes.

In contrast, statement-based replication replicates only the statements used to update data, without actually updating the data itself. This type of replication is typically used for high-performance applications where frequent updates are not necessary.

The key differences between logical replication and statement-based replication are:

*   Logical replication replicates entire rows, while statement-based replication replicates individual changes.
*   Logical replication maintains consistency across all replicas, while statement-based replication may introduce inconsistencies if the primary database is updated after the replica has been replicated.

Logical replication (row-based) is used to replicate data in a database, where the changes made by transactions are logged and stored separately from the actual data. This approach allows for more flexibility in terms of application-specific replication and easier parsing of logs.

In contrast, statement-based replication logs only the SQL statements executed during a transaction, without storing the individual rows that were modified or deleted.

Key differences between logical (row-based) and statement-based replication include:

1. **Scope**: Logical replication captures changes at the row level, whereas statement-based replication logs only the SQL statements.
2. **Flexibility**: Logical replication offers more flexibility in terms of application-specific replication, while statement-based replication is more rigid in its approach.
3. **Error handling**: Logical replication can be more error-prone due to the potential for inconsistencies between followers and leaders.

Synchronous vs Asynchronous Replication:

* Synchronous replication: The leader waits for a response from the follower before considering the write complete. This ensures consistency but can lead to delays and increased latency.
* Asynchronous replication: The leader does not wait for confirmation, allowing writes to be distributed more quickly. However, this approach may result in eventual consistency, as followers may not receive updates immediately.

Challenges associated with synchronous replication:

* **Leader failure**: What happens when the leader fails? How do you pick a new leader and configure clients to start writing to the new leader?
* **Consensus strategy**: How do you resolve conflicts between leaders and followers?

Asynchronous replication offers more availability but comes at the cost of delayed or eventual consistency.

Read-after-Write Consistency:

This refers to the scenario where a user adds a comment to a post, and after submitting the change, their comment appears in the main post. However, for other users, this may not be immediately visible.

Implementing Read-After-Write Consistency:

1. **Modifiable data**: Always read from the leader.
2. **Dynamically switch**: Switch to reading from the leader for ""recently updated"" data (e.g., within one minute of last update).

However, this approach can create its own challenges.

Monotonic Read Consistency:

This ensures that when a user makes multiple reads, they will not read older data after previously reading newer data. This is achieved by maintaining a consistent order of updates across followers.

Consistent Prefix Reads:

This guarantees that if a sequence of writes happens in a certain order, anyone reading those writes will see the same order. This approach helps to mitigate monotonic read anomalies caused by different partitions replicating data at different rates.",346.6367188,4

Logical Replication:

The purpose of logical replication in databases is to allow users to create a copy of data from one database and replicate it to another database for various reasons such as business needs or compliance with regulatory requirements. Logical replication enables you to create an exact copy of your data, including the schema, that can be used in a different database or environment.

Statement-Based Replication:

Statement-based replication is another method of replicating data between databases. This type of replication uses SQL statements and procedures to replicate the changes made to one database at another. The main difference between statement-based and row-based replication is how they handle transactions. In statement-based replication, a single transaction is replicated as a single SQL statement, whereas in row-based replication, each operation within a transaction is replicated individually.

The key differences between logical replication and statement-based replication are:

*   Logical Replication: This involves creating an exact replica of the database by applying the same rules for transactions and data access. The main benefit of using this type of replication is that it allows users to replicate their database schema, including the structure and layout of the data.
*   Statement-Based Replication: In this scenario, changes made to one database are replicated as a set of SQL statements, which can be used to update another database.

In summary, logical replication creates an exact replica of your data by replicating the entire database based on the rules for transactions and data access. On the other hand, statement-based replication involves replicating changes made to a database using a single SQL statement at a time.",245.03125,4

   According to the official Redis documentation (https://redis.io/docs/management/databases/), Redis supports up to 16 different databases by default. Each database is identified by a number between 0 and 15, with 0 being the default database.

   In addition, Redis supports multiple ways of selecting or changing the current database using commands like `SELECT` and `SWITCH DATABASE`. This enables developers to work with different datasets in separate databases as needed.

   Lastly, it's important to note that some Redis clients, such as redis-cli, only interact with a single database at a time, but you can still switch between them using the `SELECT` command or by specifying the database number when connecting to Redis server.

   Synchronous and Asynchronous replication are two types of logical replication. In synchronous replication, the leader waits for a response from the follower before confirming the transaction, while in asynchronous replication, the leader doesn't wait for confirmation. This difference is significant when it comes to handling leader failures, as in synchronous replication, if the leader fails, all transactions will be blocked until a new leader is appointed and confirmed by all followers. In contrast, with asynchronous replication, when the leader fails, there may be writes that haven't been propagated to the followers, creating challenges such as how to recover lost writes or decide on a new leader node.

   The documents also discuss the challenges of configuring clients to start writing to the new leader after a failure and avoiding having multiple leaders. Strategies for dealing with these challenges include using a consensus strategy (perhaps based on who has the most updates) or appointing a controller node to appoint a new leader.

   There are different strategies for replication like the single leader model, multiple leader model, and leaderless model, and distributed databases usually adopt one of these strategies. In the leader-based model, all writes from clients go to the leader, which then sends replication information to the followers. Clients can read from either the leader or followers.

   Replication information is transmitted to followers using methods such as statement-based and logical (row-based) replication. Statement-based replication is simple but error-prone due to issues with non-deterministic functions, trigger side-effects, and handling concurrent transactions.
