A RAG architecture for my course notes. We reccomend using Anaconda Powershell for the following steps.

1. if this is your first time running the project, make sure to run: 
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

2. Then, run this command to activate the virtual environment:
For MacOS:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
For Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install requirements needed using this command in the same foler:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
